# VirusTotal Android

EDIT: This project has been deemed finished and wont receive anymore updates unless wanted by me.

EDIT2: Since Website2APK flagged the version of the tool used to make this project as cracked, i've decided to revive this project via React Native.

Last Update: 2026.02.13

A [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) port to Android made with React Native.

Sometimes, using VirusTotal on Android isnt the best experience, so i've decided to help you by making a dedicated app for it! That way, you dont have to open your browser all the time to enter its URL ;)
The app is pretty useful if you want it quick.

Yes, i know, there is a release of VirusTotal made by funnycat available on the Play Store but this project is just another thing I dared myself to make for fun, it's not made for competition.

By the way, if you think this is a virus (which it is not), you can check the source code or scan the app via VirusTotal! What a coincidence!
