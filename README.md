A [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) port to Android made with Website2APK

Sometimes, using VirusTotal on Android isnt the best experience, so i decided to help you by making a dedicated app! That way, you dont have to open your browser all the time ;)
The app is pretty useful if you wanna be quick

I know, there is a release made by funnycat available on the Play Store but it doesn't really feel like VirusTotal. My version is the original web version and also another project I dared myself to make. I'm not saying anything or hating against funnycat, since I like his project too!

And also, if you think this is a virus (which it is not), you can you VirusTotal to scan it! What a coincidence
